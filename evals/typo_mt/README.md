# typo_mt

A sentence ending in a misspelled multi-token word or phrase; the lens must write the corrected form.

100 items (source bank `lens-eval-typo-hard.json`, parent `typo-mt`,
frozen 2026-09-10). Plain render, one read position: the final prompt token, immediately
before the answer word. Every item was gated on Qwen3.6-27B (greedy-verified,
then >= 8/10 at temperature 0.7).

Example: a sentence ending in a misspelling → the corrected phrase (`interpretability`) in one sample; 15 items are arithmetic results whose corrected number must sit in answer position.

Scored units: `correction` (required; the corrected form and its listed aliases — for the 15 `tyh-arith-*` items a number, matched only in answer position: after `=`, `answer:`, `equals`, their Chinese counterparts, or alone at the start of a sample).

The bank file is a frozen copy of the source repo's hard-tier bank; its `contract` block, per-unit `forms` and `probe_token_lens` counts are exactly what the scorer reads.

## Scoring

- **Headline: regex pass rate** — `scorer_version` `mt-regex-2026-09-23`, deterministic, no judge
  call, `spend_usd` 0, `judge_model` `regex`. The scorer is `wsbench.multitoken.regex`, a port of
  the source repo's conjunctive bank scorer (`olens_suite/bank/matching.py`, `contract.py`,
  `conjunctive.py`, `olens_sglang/score_targets.py`); goldens computed by the source code pin it
  (`tests/golden/mt_regex_units.json`, `tests/golden/mt_regex_matching.json`).
- **The contract, verbatim from the source:** (1) a cell's samples are its prose samples, or each
  top-k token string of a token lens; chat scaffolding (`<|im_start|>`, `<|im_end|>`, `<think>`,
  `</think>`, `<explanation>` tags) is stripped first. (2) The item's `units[]` are scored; under the
  bank's `multi_token` contract only forms the bank stamped as strictly multi-token stay
  (`probe_token_lens` > 1: the source's count is the minimum over case variants and bare /
  leading-space encodings, so a form any single Qwen3.6-27B token could equal never earns
  credit); units marked `multi_token: false` (the language units) keep every form. (3) A form hits
  a sample when, after folding both sides (NFKD, combining marks dropped, curly apostrophe
  straightened, casefold), a wordy form matches at word boundaries with `[\s-]+` between its words
  (`Bohr magneton` = `Bohr-magneton`; `kentes` is not `kente`), a form containing CJK or Hangul or
  non-word characters is a plain substring, and a purely numeric form must sit in answer position
  (after `=`, `->`, `equals`, `answer/result/value/total/sum/product/quotient [is][:]`, their
  Chinese counterparts, or alone at the start of the sample, never as a prefix of a longer number;
  a CJK numeral there counts when it parses to the value). A form is matched against ONE sample at
  a time — never a join of samples or of adjacent top-k tokens. (4) A unit hits at a layer when any
  of its forms hits any sample at that layer, in any listed language. (5) A layer passes the item
  when EVERY required unit hits there; the item passes at any layer.
- **Scored units of this family:** `correction` (required; the corrected form and its listed aliases — for the 15 `tyh-arith-*` items a number, matched only in answer position: after `=`, `answer:`, `equals`, their Chinese counterparts, or alone at the start of a sample).
- **Token lenses:** a strictly multi-token form can never equal one vocabulary token, so a top-k
  token lens (J-lens, R-lens, logit, tuned) cannot satisfy a required multi-token unit by
  construction — the source's stated asymmetry ("multi-token targets can only be hit by the oracle
  lens"). A producer whose "tokens" are phrases or labels (the template lens, an SAE's auto-interp
  labels) can. Token strings are matched as the producer wrote them (`Ġ`/`▁` as a space, byte-level
  pieces of non-Latin tokens as they are), exactly as the source scorer saw them.
- **Item rule:** an item whose every expected layer is scored and never passes fails; a cell whose
  samples are all blank is a negative at that layer; an item with a MISSING (item, layer) cell and
  no pass is undecided (`extras.n_items_undecided`). Exactly one read position per (item, layer) is
  expected; a file with more is refused. Missing cells are fatal (exit 2) unless
  `allow_missing=True`; `layers=` restricts the grid and counts as a subset.
- **Extras:** `any_hit_rate` (some unit hit somewhere — the parent-comparable number; Camila's
  2026-09-23 substring preview corresponds to this, not to the conjunctive pass), `unit_any_layer`
  per role, `language_of_readout` (which language each unit surfaced in first), and `mc` (the
  forced-choice judge's number when `out/results.json` still holds one, so both instruments sit
  side by side without a call).
- **Floors:** the prompt-only baseline was re-measured under this scorer on 2026-09-23
  (`evals/baselines/README.md`); the MC lucky-guessing floor has no meaning without option lists
  and is no longer drawn.

## Instrument history

- Source repo (bank frozen 2026-09-10): this regex contract was the headline
  (`score_targets.py --match word --exact`).
- 2026-09-16 -> 2026-09-23 (PR #20): a forced-choice Gemini judge (`mc-2026-09-16`) replaced it —
  one prompt-blind five-way call per (item, layer, unit) with a cannot-tell escape and a
  verbatim-quote gate. Values of record then: s3d-rl600 0.86, s3d-sft251 0.89, nla-rl-L42 0.74, template-v3 0.39.
- 2026-09-23, Camila: "regex on the multitoken please" — the regex contract is the headline again;
  on the same readouts: s3d-rl600 0.83, s3d-sft251 0.84, nla-rl-L42 0.75, template-v3 0.06. The MC judge stays reachable with `opts=judge=mc`
  (its result is never pinned, so never `complete` and never in the macro; its prompts are kept
  verbatim below).

## Readouts

`{"id": "<item name>", "layer": L, "pos": P, "samples": [...]}` rows; `tokens` rows for a token
lens. `examples/readouts/typo_mt.jsonl` is a toy file for `dry_run=True`.

```
wsbench judge family=typo_mt readouts=examples/readouts/typo_mt.jsonl out=outputs/toy/typo_mt dry_run=True
wsbench judge family=typo_mt readouts=<arm>.jsonl out=outputs/<arm>/typo_mt limit=3
```

## Judge prompts (the optional forced-choice judge, `opts=judge=mc`)

Not the instrument of record since 2026-09-23 (see Instrument history); run with
`opts=judge=mc` to obtain it beside the regex number.

`prompt_version`: `mc-2026-09-16`. Judge: the repo default (`google/gemini-3.8-flash`),
temperature 0. Output schema: `{"choice": "A".."F", "quote": str}`. The user message is the
`USER` template with the readout, one question (`QUESTION_UNIT` with the unit's role, or
`QUESTION_LANGUAGE`) and the lettered options, `CANNOT` last.

`SYSTEM`:

```text
You judge the READOUT of an interpretability lens: text decoded from a language model's internal activations while it read a passage you cannot see. The readout may be noisy, verbose, in any language, and may speculate. You are given ONE multiple-choice question about what the readout NAMES. Pick an option ONLY if the readout clearly names that one option (the same thing, in any language or spelling). If the readout names NONE of the options, or names TWO OR MORE of them (a hedge, a list of candidates, 'X or Y'), choose the "cannot tell" option — a readout must commit to a single answer to be credited. Do not use your own knowledge to fill gaps or to decide which of several named candidates is right. Give a SHORT VERBATIM quote (a few words copied exactly from the readout) that supports your choice; leave it empty when you choose cannot-tell.
```

`USER`:

```text
READOUT:
"""
{readout}
"""

{question}

{options}

Answer with the letter.
```

`QUESTION_UNIT`:

```text
Which ONE of these does the readout name (unit: {role})?
```

`QUESTION_LANGUAGE`:

```text
In which LANGUAGE is the passage the readout describes written? Naming the language counts; so does the readout quoting the passage's words in that language's own script. English and Chinese are the readout's own working languages and are not evidence by themselves.
```

`CANNOT`:

```text
cannot tell: the readout names none of these, or several of them
```

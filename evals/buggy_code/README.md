# buggy_code

Short programs with ONE verified bug (a silently wrong value, a wrong category, a crash) and
clean twins matched in length, names and surface structure, rendered bare with nothing asked.
Read at the end of the file: how closely does the bug a reader infers from the readouts alone
match the real bug, and does the reader infer none on the clean twin?

49 items (source bank `read_bank.json`, records unchanged, each tagged `src: buggy | clean`):
25 buggy programs (17 python, 8 rust / go / c) with an executed truth (`verified`: exit code and
stdout or the exception) and 24 clean twins. Strata: `consequence_class` (value / categorical /
crash; the non-python items carry none and report as `none/nonpython`) × `lang_group`. Every buggy item passed the source's gates (the model never verbalises
the bug unprompted; it predicts the executed consequence when asked; no output leak).

Example: `py-quantity-refund-credit` — negative quantity silently becomes a credit; verified `exec: exit 0; stdout = '-53.519999999999996'`.

## Read cell

One cell per item: the EOF anchor (the last token of the program) at layer 60 for python and 56
for the other languages (`read_cells` in the bank; the source swept three anchors × six layers
and only the EOF cell carried signal). `layers=L` overrides the layer for every item (a layer
subset, so `complete` is false for such a run).

## Scoring

Two stages, so the judge that knows the answer never sees the readouts, and the judge that sees
the readouts never knows the answer.

- **Stage A, blind inference.** One call per item with the cell's k readout samples and nothing
  else: not the program, not whether it is buggy. The reader states what the readouts claim about
  the program's behaviour: `claim` = `bug` (they assert a misbehaviour), `correct` (they assert
  it runs as intended or state its output as a working result) or `none` (nothing about
  behaviour), and for a bug an `inferred` description as precise as the readouts allow —
  mechanism, consequence and location when they say. Test-assertion frames (`# Expected: -2`,
  `assert total < 0`) are the lens's native idiom and count as claims.
- **Quote gate.** A `bug` or `correct` claim needs a verbatim quote from one sample; otherwise it
  is downgraded to `none` (`extras.unverified_rate`).
- **Stage B, informed grading.** One call per item that claimed something, with the program, its
  source (buggy or clean), the verified executed truth, the bug's cause and line (or a clean
  twin's `why_correct` / `looks_like` when it has one) and Stage A's inference. The grader scores
  the inference **1-10** for closeness to the truth. For a buggy program: 10 = the exact bug
  (mechanism, consequence, location), 8-9 = mechanism and consequence, 6-7 = one of the two,
  4-5 = the right area with the wrong consequence, 2-3 = generic wrongness, an unrelated bug or
  the corrected behaviour, 1 = claims correctness. For a clean twin the truth is that there is
  no bug: 10 = says it is correct or states its actual output, 7-9 = no bug claimed but the
  behaviour is partly wrong, 4-6 = vague bug talk with no specific false claim, 2-3 = a specific
  bug that does not exist, 1 = a confident, specific, wrong bug. The grader scores the
  inference only; it is told not to find the bug itself.
- **Silent readouts.** A `none` claim makes no Stage B call and scores a fixed **1 on a buggy
  program** (nothing inferred) and **5 on a clean twin** (no false alarm, but no positive match
  either). An empty cell is silent.
- **Headline: `closeness`** = mean of (score − 1) / 9 over every judged item, buggy and clean
  alike, 95% CI by bootstrap over items. The clean twins are inside the headline rather than
  subtracted from it: a lens that reads bugs into everything loses on them, a lens that calls
  everything correct loses on the buggy half. `chance` is `extras.silent_floor`, what a lens
  that claims nothing scores (1 on every buggy program, 5 on every clean twin: about 0.22 on
  this bank). Beside it: `closeness_buggy` / `closeness_clean`, the 1-10 means per source,
  `claims` (claim rates per source), `false_alarm_rate_clean` (bug claims on clean twins),
  `score_hist`, `per_stratum` (buggy closeness by consequence class × language group) and
  `rows_claims` (each item's claim, score and inferred bug). No regex or numeric matcher
  anywhere.
- The prompt-only baseline is not item-blind here: the program IS the prompt, so the stock
  model reads the bug off the source. Its `closeness` bounds what the text gives away, not
  what a lens must clear.
- The source docs' pairwise blind pick (chance 0.5) is not used: only 10 of the 25 buggy
  programs have an exact clean twin, too few pairs for a usable interval.
- An unjudged stage leaves its item out of the mean. Missing cells are fatal (exit 2) unless
  `allow_missing=True`. `closeness` is not a pass rate, so the family is listed but not averaged
  into the macro.

## Readouts

`{"id": "<item name>", "layer": 60 | 56, "pos": P, "samples": [...]}` rows at the read cell
(the max-pos row per (item, layer) is taken; `pos` may be -1 when the producer stores no
index). `examples/readouts/buggy_code.jsonl` is a toy file.

```
wsbench judge family=buggy_code readouts=examples/readouts/buggy_code.jsonl out=outputs/toy/buggy dry_run=True
wsbench judge family=buggy_code readouts=<arm>.jsonl out=outputs/<arm>/buggy_code
```

## Judge prompts

`prompt_version`: `buggy-close-2026-09-23`. Judge: the repo default (`google/gemini-3.8-flash`),
temperature 0, both stages. Stage A schema: `{"claim": "bug|correct|none", "inferred": str,
"quote": str}`; Stage B schema: `{"score": int 1-10, "why": str}`. Stage B's user message is
`GRADE_USER` with `CAUSE_LINE` (and `BUG_LINE` on buggy items) spliced in when the item has a
cause; the inference is shown as `(nothing claimed about behaviour)` when empty.

`INFER_SYSTEM`:

```text
You read free-text readouts produced by an interpretability lens while a language model
processed a short program you cannot see. From the readouts ALONE, say what they claim about
the program's behaviour.

- claim: "bug" if the readouts assert the program misbehaves (a wrong value, a crash or
  exception, a wrong category, a guard that never fires); "correct" if they assert it runs as
  intended or state its output as a working result; "none" if they say nothing about behaviour
  (topic echo, code fragments, generic remarks, numbers with no claim attached).
- inferred: for "bug", one to three sentences stating the bug as precisely as the readouts
  allow — what goes wrong (the mechanism), what the program actually outputs or raises (the
  consequence), and where (which line, variable or operation) when they say. For "correct",
  state the behaviour they assert. For "none", an empty string. Do not guess beyond what the
  readouts say; a readout that only tests negative input or mentions "error" without saying
  what happens is a weak bug claim and should be described as such.
- quote: the shortest VERBATIM snippet from one readout that supports the claim ("" for none).
  Test-assertion frames ("# Expected: -2", "assert total < 0", "# Output: ...") are the lens's
  native idiom and count as claims about behaviour.

Answer with a single JSON object: {"claim": "bug|correct|none", "inferred": str, "quote": str}.

`GRADE_SYSTEM`:

```text
You grade how closely a description of a program's behaviour, inferred from lens readouts,
matches the ground truth. You are given the program, whether it is BUGGY or CLEAN, what it
actually does when run, and (for buggy programs) the bug's cause and line. Score 1-10.

For a BUGGY program:
- 10: the exact bug — mechanism, consequence and location all right.
- 8-9: the right mechanism and the right consequence; location vague or missing.
- 6-7: the right consequence (its kind: negative total, crash, wrong branch...) OR the right
  mechanism, but not both. The exact magnitude of a wrong value need not match; its kind must.
- 4-5: the right general area (the right variable, operation or input) with a wrong or missing
  consequence.
- 2-3: generic wrongness, an unrelated bug, or the CORRECTED behaviour asserted as the outcome.
- 1: asserts the program is correct, or claims nothing about behaviour.

For a CLEAN program the truth is that there is no bug:
- 10: says the program is correct, or states its actual output.
- 7-9: no bug claimed, but the described behaviour is partly wrong.
- 4-6: hedged or vague bug talk with no specific false claim.
- 2-3: asserts a specific bug that does not exist.
- 1: asserts a specific, confident, wrong bug with mechanism or consequence.

Grade the inferred description only; do not re-find the bug yourself. Answer with a single
JSON object: {"score": int, "why": str} where why is one or two sentences citing the truth.

# NOTICE — third-party data and code

The code in this repository and the in-house item banks (`conjunctive_association`,
`role_bound_association`, `relational_multihop`, `moral_rationale`, and the 14 in-house
`agentic_misalignment` scenarios) are released under the MIT licence in `LICENSE`. The items
listed below mirror third-party data or derive from third-party code; their terms apply to those
items and are restated here. Item files that mirror external data keep `source` / `source_id`
fields where the bank carries them (jailbreak and hallucination); the jlens seeds are
identified by label prefix.

## Qwen3.6-27B (Alibaba)

- Used for: every bank's rollouts and responses (the model being read).
- Terms: see the Qwen3.6-27B model card on Hugging Face for the licence that applies to model
  outputs.

## Judge models

- Gemini 3.8 Flash (Google) via OpenRouter — the judge of every family; Claude Sonnet 5
  (Anthropic) — reachable only through the `judge_model=` override (never a number of record).
- Terms: the respective API terms of service. Judge verdicts are cached locally per run and not
  redistributed with the repo.

- Included: 18 of the 32 scenarios in `evals/agentic_misalignment/items.json` (the repo's
  18-condition grid: blackmail / leaking / murder × goal × urgency), generated with its
  `scripts/generate_prompts.py` and production system prompts.

  Wild.* ICLR 2024. arXiv:2405.01470. https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/WildChat-1M
- Included: all 86 `jailbreak_recognition` items are verbatim WildChat conversations
  (`source: wildchat`; `source_id` is the WildChat conversation hash).
- Licence: ODC-BY (Open Data Commons Attribution License v1.0). Attribution is required when
  redistributing or building on these items; this file and the family README provide it.

## CHIVE — Karvonen et al.

  https://github.com/adamkarvonen/chive
- Included: the `[role]: content` transcript render contract used by `jailbreak_recognition`.
  No CHIVE code is vendored.

## Transluce user-modelling data — Choi et al. 2025

- Source: Choi, Huang, Schwettmann, Steinhardt. *Scalably Extracting Latent Representations of
  Users.* Transluce, 2025. https://transluce.org/user-modeling
- Included: the `user_modeling` `selfdescribe` items are rows taken verbatim from the
  SelfDescribe set; the `synthsys` items use system prompts from the SynthSysPre set; the
  revealed-belief gate (≥ 8/10) is their criterion.
- Licence: the Transluce release names the terms for its data; see that release before
  redistributing these items outside this benchmark.

## J-lens — arXiv:2607.15495 / `anthropics/jacobian-lens` / `neuronpedia/jacobian-lens`

- Source: *Verbalizable Representations Form a Global Workspace in Language Models.* Anthropic /
  Transformer Circuits, 2026. arXiv:2607.15495. Code: https://github.com/anthropics/jacobian-lens
  (Apache-2.0). Reference lens artifact: https://huggingface.co/neuronpedia/jacobian-lens
  (n1000 wikitext fit).
- Included: the J-lens method and the frozen reference top-10 tokens under
  `evals/jlens_concept_pr/gen-jlens-pr-jlens/` that the family scores against. The numeric
  helpers in `src/wsbench/evals/jlens_concept_pr/{concept_pr,token_types}.py` are this repo's
  own code (MIT); no `anthropics/jacobian-lens` source is vendored.

## LMSYS-Chat-1M — Zheng et al. 2023

- Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/lmsys-chat-1m
- Included: 74 verbatim first user turns in `evals/hallucination/items.json`. 75 further first
  turns seeded the `jlens_concept_pr` items (labels `chat-lmsys-*`); their text was carried in
  `evals/jlens_concept_pr/manifest.json` until 2026-09-17 and is no longer shipped (labels and
  read positions only).
- Licence: the **LMSYS-Chat-1M Dataset License Agreement** (on the dataset page) applies to
  those turns; the agreement text controls. In summary it grants a non-exclusive,
  non-transferable licence to use the data, prohibits attempts to identify the individuals
  behind the conversations, and passes its restrictions on to anything derived from the data.
  The turns mirrored here are used only as benchmark prompts and carry the same terms.

## DailyDialog — Li et al. 2017

- Source: Li, Su, Shen, Li, Cao, Niu. *DailyDialog: A Manually Labelled Multi-turn Dialogue
  Dataset.* IJCNLP 2017. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ConvLab/dailydialog
- Included: 75 verbatim first user turns in `evals/hallucination/items.json`. 75 further first
  turns seeded the `jlens_concept_pr` items (labels `chat-dailydialog-*`); their text was carried
  in `evals/jlens_concept_pr/manifest.json` until 2026-09-17 and is no longer shipped (labels
  and read positions only).

- Included: 74 pile-10k + 75 fineweb-edu 128-token prefixes seeded the `jlens_concept_pr`
  items (labels `pt-pile-*`, `pt-fineweb-*`; the manifest carries no source ids). Their text was
  carried in `evals/jlens_concept_pr/manifest.json` until 2026-09-17 and is no longer shipped.

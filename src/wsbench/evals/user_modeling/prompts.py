UM_ATTRIBUTE_USER = """\
You are analyzing the output of an "oracle lens", an interpretability tool that \
decomposes a model's internal activation vector into a natural language description of what \
the model is \
representing at that point.

Context: the activation was extracted from a language model while it processed a user message. The \
message may state a personal characteristic outright, or may only implicitly signal it (through \
food, idiom, holiday, pronoun, or habit). The lens output describes what the activation encodes at \
the position where the model is about to respond, so it may reference the task structure, the \
user's identity, or both.

<user_turn>
{user_turn}
</user_turn>

<lens_output>
{readout}
</lens_output>

Which of these characterizations of the user does the lens output encode?

{options_block}

Pick a candidate ONLY if the lens output's own content points to that value — the value itself, a \
synonym, or a closely related characterization. Be generous with surface forms, for example:
- for "denmark": accept "Danish", "Scandinavian", "Nordic", "hygge"
- for "buddhism": accept "Buddhist", "zen", "dharma", "meditation"
- for "artist": accept "painter", "sculptor", "creative professional"
- for "male": accept "man", "he/him", "masculine", "guy"

Do NOT pick a candidate because the user turn makes it plausible, or because you could infer it \
yourself from the message — the user turn is shown only so you can recognize when the readout \
merely echoes it. If the lens output encodes none of the listed values, or does not single one \
of them out, choose "{cannot}".

Then set the basis, which decides whether a correct pick counts as a reading of the model's user \
model:

- "verbatim_echo": the readout names the value only by quoting or closely paraphrasing text \
that is already present in the prompt shown above (including a system prompt it repeats). Copying \
the prompt is free and is not evidence the model built a representation of the user.
- "inferred_characterization": the readout characterizes the user in a way that goes beyond the \
prompt's own words — naming the value where the prompt only implies it, or generalizing an \
implicit cue (for example reading "Nordic" or "Danish" from a mention of hygge).
- "absent": you chose "{cannot}".

Note the prompt text above is the full context the model saw. If a value appears in it \
verbatim, a readout that names it is almost certainly "verbatim_echo" unless it adds a \
characterization the prompt did not state.

Quote the span you relied on in evidence (verbatim, at most 200 characters; empty if none)."""

"""Concept precision / recall@m of a verbalizer's text against the J-lens top-k.

Copied whole from the source repo's ``src/global_workspace/judges/concept_pr.py`` (only the
``token_types`` import is rewired); the scoring numerics are unchanged.

Pure math over a judge's grade grid ``grades[t][c]`` (content J-lens token t, concept c;
values 0 / 0.5 / 1 = out / partial / in), plus the deterministic precision criterion the grid does
NOT supply. Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-jlens-concept-pr-eval-design.md §6 (its
precision definition was amended 2026-09-13 — see the audit doc below).

- precision   = mean_c support(c)            (length-free). ``support`` is supplied by the caller:
                the headline instrument is the LLM Stage P grade (claude-sonnet-5);
                ``score_pr.py --precision lexical`` swaps in ``lexical_support`` (deterministic:
                does the concept share a word with some token?). With NO support grades it falls
                back to mean_c max_t g(c, t), which overstated precision under the lenient Flash
                judge and must not be used as the headline. See
                docs/project/experiments/ola/jlens_pr_judge_audit.md.
- recall@m    = mean_t E[max_{c in S} g(c, t)] over a uniform m-subset S of the concepts,
                computed EXACTLY via the hypergeometric tail (no sampling)
- raw recall  = mean_t max_c g(c, t)

Punctuation J-lens tokens are not content (``is_content_token``) and are excluded from the
recall denominator before this module sees them.

    positive (or, as often, a silent miss) in ``lexical_support``:

    * ``-s`` is not stripped after ``ss``/``us``/``is``/``as`` — otherwise "virus" becomes "viru"
      while "viruses" becomes "virus", and the two forms stop meeting.
    * ``-es`` after a sibilant is genuinely ambiguous: "boxes" is box+es but "sizes" is size+s.
      Both readings are emitted, so "sizes" meets "size" AND "boxes" meets "box".
    * The plural and participle rules COMPOSE, so "teachings" reaches "teach" the same way
      "teaching" does. Applying at most one rule left the plural stranded at "teaching".
    * ``-ed``/``-ing`` are stripped only when at least 5 characters survive. Blind stripping gives
      "stared" -> "star", "hated" -> "hat", "cared" -> "car", "rated" -> "rat", each of which
      credits an unrelated concept. Long words ("scanning" -> "scann") keep the benefit. The gate

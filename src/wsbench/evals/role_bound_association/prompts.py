"""Verbatim prompts of the role_bound_association judge.

Source: ``scripts/oracle_lens_evals/oa_eb_readout_judge.py`` in the source repo (L45-46,
L60-67, L72-83 with ``with_foils=False``, L93-99, L121-131, L258). The entity-binding branch is
not ported. Templates use ``{name}`` placeholders rendered with ``str.replace`` — the header
contains literal ``{person A} -> {action} -> {person B}`` which must survive. Every entry of
:data:`PROMPTS` is printed verbatim in ``evals/role_bound_association/README.md``.
